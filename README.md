🚀 Object Detection with YOLO: My Latest Deep Learning Project! 🎯

Excited to share my latest project—Object Detection using YOLO! 🖼️⚡
In this project, I implemented YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art deep learning model for real-time object detection. The model efficiently detects multiple objects in an image with high accuracy and speed.

🔍 Key Highlights:
✅ Implemented YOLO for object detection
✅ Used a pretrained model for better accuracy
✅ Processed images with bounding boxes for detected objects

This project deepened my understanding of computer vision and real-time detection, reinforcing the power of deep learning in applications like autonomous driving, security surveillance, and smart vision systems.
